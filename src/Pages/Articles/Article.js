        <h4>Why we need to Donate blood</h4>
        <h5>
          Blood donation is a major concern to the society as donated blood is
          lifesaving for individuals who need it. Blood is scarce. There is a
          shortage to active blood donors to meet the need of increased blood
          demand. Blood donation as a therapeutic exercise. Globally,
          approximately 80 million units of blood are donated each year. One of
          the biggest challenges to blood safety particularly is accessing safe
          and adequate quantities of blood and blood products. Safe supply of
          blood and blood components is essential, to enable a wide range of
          critical care procedures to be carried out in hospitals. Good
          knowledge about blood donation practices is not transforming in
          donating blood. Interactive awareness on blood donation should be
          organized to create awareness and opportunities for blood donation.
          Blood donation could be therefore recommended that voluntary blood
          donations as often as possible may be therapeutically beneficial to
          the donors in terms of thrombotic complications and efficient blood
          flow mechanisms.
